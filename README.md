# Risk Quantification for SARS-CoV-2 Infection through Airborne Transmission in University Settings

This repository contains code associated with a manuscript describing a method of quantifying risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection through airborne transmission in university settings. 

This code functions to calculate the probability of infection during in-person classes in teaching spaces, in-person dining in dining halls, meal pick-ups from dining halls, and shared dorm and bathroom usage in residential spaces. 

To perform these calculations, all the files in this respository must be downloaded. The file [here](https://github.com/mythriambatipudi/RiskAnalysis/blob/master/RiskAnalysis.m) serves as the main function through which all the other functions can be run. Simply input the parameters specified in the order described and run the file to obtain the output parameters for each university space desired.
